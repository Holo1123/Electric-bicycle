A pedal bike modified to be electric powered

I acquired the front end of a hub motor E-Scooter (the rest was missing) from a scrap yard and was thrilled to find out that the hub motor and the control electronics were all present.
The next step was figuring out wether they still worked or not.
Figuring out the connections from the Motor controller to the other electronics was easy as all the cables had different connectors.

The BLDC motor seems to be Kunray 36V 350W E-Scooter motor and the controller requires a 36v Battery.
I was able to find a Proper Battery pack for it , 36V 10S2P Li-ion battery pack.

The major hurdle I now faced was that the there was no way to mount a gear onto the motor and the only wheels that fit was scooty wheels.
