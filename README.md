A pedal bike modified to be electric powered

I bought the front end of an E-Scooter (the rest was missing) from a scrap yard and was thrilled to find out that the hub motor and the control electronics were all present.

The next step was figuring out wether they still worked or not.
Determining what connected where was easy as all the cables had different connectors.

The BLDC motor had no markings on it but I was able to find similar motors on aliexpress being sold as Kunray 36V 350W E-Scooter motors.
The controller required a 36v Battery and I was able to find one rather easily at the same junkyard.

The major hurdle I now faced was that the there was no way to mount a gear onto the motor and the only wheels that fit were 200x50 scooty wheels.
To solve this I got a motorcycle hub machined so that the motor would fit inside
