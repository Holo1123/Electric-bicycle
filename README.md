# Electric-bicycle
A pedal bike modified to be electric powered

I acquired the front end of a hub motor E-Scooter (the rest was missing) from a scrap yard and was thrilled to find out that the hub motor and the control electronics were all present.
The next step was figuring out wether they still worked or not.
Figuring out the connections from the Motor controller to the other electronics was easy enough as all the cables had different connectors.
